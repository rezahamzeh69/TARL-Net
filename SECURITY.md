\# Security Policy



\## Goal

This document describes how to report vulnerabilities and how we respond for the \*\*TARL-Net (ics-ot-wadi-hybrid-ids)\*\* repository. 



> \[!WARNING]

> This project is academic research code. Please thoroughly evaluate security risks before deploying it in production Industrial Control Systems (ICS) or Operational Technology (OT) environments.

\## Scope



| In-Scope | Out-of-Scope |

| :--- | :--- |

| • Core source code and model architectures<br>• Project dependencies (`requirements.txt`)<br>• Example configurations and pipeline run scripts | • Third-party datasets (e.g., Kaggle, UNSW-NB15, WADI)<br>• External hosting services or infrastructure |

\## Supported Versions

We officially provide security review and support for the following versions:



| Version / Branch | Supported | Notes |

| :--- | :---: | :--- |

| `main` branch |  Yes | Active development and latest tagged releases (Best Effort). |

| Older Versions | ⚠️ Case-by-Case | Reviewed only for \*\*High\*\* or \*\*Critical\*\* security issues. |

\## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do not open a public GitHub Issue. Instead, use one of the following secure channels:



1\. \*\*Preferred:\*\* Open a private \*\*GitHub Security Advisory\*\* directly through this repository.

2\. \*\*Alternative:\*\* Email the security contact at \*\*rezahamzeh.sh@gmail.com\*\* with the subject line: `\[ics-ot-wadi-hybrid-ids] Vulnerability Report`.



\### What to include in your report:

To help us triage and fix the issue quickly, please include:

\* \*\*Component:\*\* The affected file, module, or dependency with a brief description.

\* \*\*Environment:\*\* Version/commit hash, Operating System, and Python environment details.

\* \*\*Proof of Concept (PoC):\*\* Step-by-step instructions or a minimal script to reproduce the issue.

\* \*\*Impact:\*\* Potential attack vectors and the severity of the impact.

\* \*\*Mitigation:\*\* Any temporary workarounds or fix ideas (if available).



\---



\## Disclosure Process

\* \*\*Acknowledgment:\*\* We will acknowledge receipt of your report within \*\*3 business days\*\*.

\* \*\*Assessment:\*\* We evaluate the severity using the CVSS v3.1 framework.

\* \*\*Remediation:\*\* We aim to patch \*\*High\*\* or \*\*Critical\*\* vulnerabilities within \*\*14 business days\*\* whenever feasible.

\* \*\*Coordinated Disclosure:\*\* We kindly ask to keep all vulnerability details confidential until an official patch or workaround is released. Public disclosure will be coordinated mutually with the reporter.



\---



\## Risk Mitigations

\* \*\*Research-Oriented:\*\* This is a research repository; it does not implement host or network hardening mechanisms by default.

\* \*\*Sandboxing:\*\* Always execute this notebook/code within isolated, sandboxed environments (e.g., restricted Docker containers or virtual machines) and avoid processing sensitive corporate data.

\* \*\*Secrets Management:\*\* Never commit API keys, Kaggle tokens, or system credentials to the repository. Utilize environment variables or local configuration managers.



\---



\## Security Best Practices

\* Use a dedicated virtual environment (`venv` or `conda env`) for running the pipeline.

\* Keep dependencies up to date and regularly audit them using automated tools like `pip-audit` or `safety`.

\* Enable automated GitHub CI/CD workflows to run unit tests and dependency scans on new Pull Requests.
